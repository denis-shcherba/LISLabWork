About the OmniBaseModelling:
you need to have openSCAD and solidPython installed.
The most recent version is base_idea2. you can add things there. base idea 1 is goint to be an alternative concept (maybe?) and is still incomplete.
Run the python code and you can view the generated scad file with openScad.
